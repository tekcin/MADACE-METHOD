## Just-In-Time Tech Specs

As each epic is implemented, create detailed tech specs that reference this
architecture:

- `tech-spec-epic-1.md` - Detailed spec for Epic 1
- `tech-spec-epic-2.md` - Detailed spec for Epic 2
- etc.

These JIT specs will expand on the architecture above with
implementation-specific details.
