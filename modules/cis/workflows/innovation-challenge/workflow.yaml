        ðŸš€ Innovation Challenge Workshop

        Push beyond conventional thinking with this structured
        innovation process.

        We'll explore provocations, constraints, and breakthroughs!

    - name: Define Challenge
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Innovation Challenge**

        What challenge or opportunity are you tackling?

        Challenge:

    - name: Current State
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Current State**

        What's the current approach or solution?
        What are its limitations?

        Current state:

    - name: Provocations
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Provocations**

        Answer these provocative questions:
        - What if money was no object?
        - What if you had to 10x the result?
        - What would a child suggest?
        - What would the opposite solution be?

        Your provocative ideas:

    - name: Constraints as Opportunities
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Constraints as Opportunities**

        What if you added constraints?
        - Half the budget?
        - Half the time?
        - Can only use 3 features?

        How would these constraints drive innovation?

        Constraint-driven ideas:

    - name: Analogies
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Analogies & Metaphors**

        How do other industries solve similar problems?
        - How does nature solve this?
        - How does tech solve this?
        - How does art solve this?

        Analogies and insights:

    - name: Breakthrough Ideas
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Breakthrough Ideas**

        Synthesize your thinking:
        What are your 3 most breakthrough ideas?

        Breakthrough ideas:

    - name: Render Innovation Report
