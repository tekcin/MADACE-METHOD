        ðŸŽ¨ Design Thinking Workshop

        Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation.

        5 Stages:
        1. Empathize - Understand the user
        2. Define - Frame the problem
        3. Ideate - Generate solutions
        4. Prototype - Build to think
        5. Test - Learn and iterate

        Let's begin!

    - name: Stage 1 - Empathize
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Stage 1: EMPATHIZE** - Understand the user

        Questions:
        - Who is the user?
        - What are their needs, pains, and desires?
        - What's their context and environment?
        - What have you observed about their behavior?

        Your empathy insights:

    - name: Stage 2 - Define
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Stage 2: DEFINE** - Frame the problem

        Create a "How Might We" statement:
        - Based on your empathy work, what's the real problem?
        - Frame it as an opportunity, not a constraint
        - Make it human-centered

        Format: "How might we [action] for [user] so that [benefit]?"

        Your problem statement:

    - name: Stage 3 - Ideate
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Stage 3: IDEATE** - Generate many solutions

        Brainstorm wildly:
        - Quantity over quality
        - Build on others' ideas
        - Go for wild ideas
        - Defer judgment

        Your solution ideas (one per line):

    - name: Stage 4 - Prototype
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Stage 4: PROTOTYPE** - Build to think

        Select top 3 ideas and describe simple prototypes:
        - What's the minimum version to test the idea?
        - What can you build quickly and cheaply?
        - What's the core assumption to validate?

        Your prototype plans:

    - name: Stage 5 - Test
      action: elicit
      prompt: |
        **Stage 5: TEST** - Learn and iterate

        Design your tests:
        - Who will you test with?
        - What questions will you ask?
        - What metrics will you track?
        - How will you iterate?

        Your testing plan:

    - name: Render Design Thinking Report
      action: render_template
      template: templates/design-thinking-report.md
      output_file: "{output_folder}/design-thinking-{project_slug}.md"
      variables:
        empathize: "{empathize}"
        define: "{define}"
        ideate: "{ideate}"
        prototype: "{prototype}"
        test: "{test}"
        date: "{date}"

    - name: Confirm Complete
      action: display
      message: |
        âœ… Design Thinking Workshop Complete!

        File: {output_folder}/design-thinking-{project_slug}.md

        You've gone through all 5 stages of human-centered innovation!

        Next: Build your prototypes and test with real users.
